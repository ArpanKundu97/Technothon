# Human Trafficking

Increasing numbers of young people are being trafficked online. Machine learning techniques can be used in order to prevent the same. Given a record of all previously identified human trafficking communications, a model can be built in order to identify frequently occurring patterns, such as **{Open for all, Travel expenses reimbursed} -> {Get an amazing experience}**. Normally genuine communications won't promise a reimbursement of travel expenses in case it is open for all.
Once such a model is created, whenever a new website initiates a new domain registration, it can be checked for the occurrence of such suspicious patterns and in case it does contain such patterns, an extensive investigation can be conducted before granting a domain. An app can also be built which can be installed by users in order to scan any mail received by them for the occurrence of such patterns and alert the user on the identification of such patterns.
